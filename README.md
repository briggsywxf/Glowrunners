Glowrunners is a local-multiplayer, ragdoll physics racing game. The aim is simple - navigate a course filled with tracherous physics-based obstacles and wild powerups - and faster than your opponent!

Glowrunners was created in 24 hours for Bath Hack 2021, in collaboration with Simon Balfe, and James Johnson.

Following on from some smaller learning projects, and OxfordHack 2020 submission Bob Ross the Boss, Glowrunners built upon lessons learned previously (like not biting off more than we can chew!), and while light on features, is heavy on fun!

Glowrunners was created entirely in Unity game engine, using C# scripting.
